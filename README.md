### UI & UX Concept for WEEKLY SCHEDULE
Task: 
- Create a page where the hospital employee can choose the time at which he is available for work during the week.
- The schedule of the week is always repeated. Weekends can be working (no restrictions). During the day there may be a few shifts 11: 00-- 12: 00, 2:00 - 5:00
- The UI should allow to select a night shift.
